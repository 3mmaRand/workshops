Forwards Package Development Workshop Scholarship Application

Thanks to funding from the R Consortium, we are able to offer a limited number of scholarships to attend the Package Development Workshop at eRum 2018 run by Forwards, the R Foundation taskforce for women and under-represented groups. The workshop is primarily intended for women, however we are open to applications from other under-represented groups.

Please note the scholarships will only cover expenses for attending the workshop, which may include return travel to Budapest and accommodation on May 13 and/or May 14, as required. Other reasonable costs, such as childcare on May 14, may also be covered. eRum registration will be covered for all scholarship recipients, but if you wish to stay for the full conference, you will need to cover accommodation and other expenses on the remaining days.

We will award as many scholarships as our funding allows based on a combination of need and impact. Applications will be assessed by the tutors and an assistant from the eRum program committee. All information will be treated confidentially.

The deadline for applications is February 25, 2018.
