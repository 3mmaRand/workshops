Overview

An analysis of CRAN maintainers in 2016 estimated that 11.4% were women (http://forwards.github.io/data/). This proportion is much lower than the proportion of women that attended the R conference useR! in the same year (28%). In addition a survey of the participants at that useR! conference found that women were less likely than men to have experience of contributing to or writing packages (http://forwards.github.io/blog/2017/03/11/users-relationship-with-r/. Also women were less likely to use R recreationally, so perhaps have less opportunity to develop package development skills.

This workshop is designed to address this skills gap. It is for women who have done some R coding and are ready to take the next step in providing it to others to use.

During the tutorial participants will learn how to

 - make code into an R package,
 - do collaborative coding with GitHub,
 - write a vignette or an article,
 - build a package web page,
 - submit a package to CRAN.

Participants can bring their own code that they wish to make into a package, or work with our example.

R packages: knitr, devtools, pkgdown, rmarkdown, roxygen2, testthat
IDE: RStudio

Thanks to funding from the R Consortium, we are able to offer a limited number of scholarships to attend the Package Development Workshop. Please apply by filling in the application form before Feb 25, 2018.
