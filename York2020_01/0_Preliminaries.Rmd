# Preliminaries. 

## Why make a package

* You want to work reproducibly.
* You want to document.
* You want to disseminate.
* You want to collaborate.
* You want to create impact from your work.

# Preliminaries.

## Pre-workshop survey

Very short! Please complete

https://rfoundation.limequery.com/162373?lang=en

---
# Preliminaries.

## Get to know your R installation.

```{r}
R.home()

```

The R home directory is the top-level directory of the R installation being run.

---
# Preliminaries.

## Get to know your R installation.

```{r}
list.files(R.home())
```

---
# Preliminaries.

## Get to know your R installation.

```{r}
R.version
```

# Preliminaries.

## Where do R packages come from?

--

CRAN and GitHub, mostly
.pull-left[
CRAN:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("foo")
```

GitHub:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("jane/foo")
```
]
---
# Preliminaries.

## Where do R packages live on your computer?

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/library.png")
```

--

R packages live in a library.

---
# Preliminaries.

## Get to know your R library.

The default library:
```{r}
.Library
```
---
# Preliminaries.

## Get to know your R library.

All the libraries R knows about:
```{r}
.libPaths()
```


---
# Preliminaries.

## Get to know your R library.

* For many R users `.Library` and `.libPaths()` are the same.  

--

* Other R users maintain, or have access to, multiple libraries.

--

* You may not have write access to the default library.

--

* For example, you can put add-on packages in a user-level library:
`r .libPaths()[1]`

---
# Preliminaries.

## Before we start:

Make sure you have recent versions of:
.pull-left[
`devtools`  
`pkgdown`  
`roxygen2`  
]
.pull-right[
`testthat`   
`tidyverse`  
`usethis`  
]
--

Load `devtools`

```{r}
library(devtools)
```

---
# Preliminaries.

## The goal.

We are going to write a package called `mypackage`<sup>1</sup>. `mypackage` has some simple utilities for a single large sample. 

.footnote[
[1] Or be more creative, silly or serious!
]
--

It will:   
* calculate the sums of squares  
* calculate the standard error  
* carry out a one-sample z-test  

--

The package itself is not very useful or wholy original. But what the package does is not the point!

---
# Preliminaries.

## Learning Objectives.

A successful particpant will be able to:

* create a basic package and explain each of files created.  
* populate the NAMESPACE, LICENSE and DESCRIPTION files.  
* make simple use of git and github to version control a package.  
* add functions to a package.  
* use Roxygen to document functions.  
* check a package is in working order.  
* create a testing infrastructure for a package.  
* document the dependencies of a package.
