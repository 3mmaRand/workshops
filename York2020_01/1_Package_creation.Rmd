# Create your first package.

# Create your first package.

## Creating a package.

Be deliberate about where you create your package.

Do not nest inside another RStudio project, R package or git repo.

--

Then use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::create_package("path/to/mypackage")
```

---

# Create your first package.

## `usethis::create_package()`

Using `usethis::create_package()` will:

* create a new R project called mypackage which is a package and an RStudio project.
* restart R in the new project.
* create a skeleton structure for your package.
* start an RStudio helper menu.

---
# Create your first package.

## What is in this skeleton?

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/createpkg1.png")
```


---
# Create your first package.

## What is in this skeleton?

### Files and directories.

* `.Rbuildignore` lists files that we need but that should not be included when building the R package from source. e.g., the `.Rproj` file and the LICENSE

--

* `.Rproj.user`, if you have it, is a directory used internally by RStudio.

--

* `.gitignore` anticipates Git usage and ignores some standard, behind-the-scenes files created by R and RStudio.


---
# Create your first package.

## What is in this skeleton?

### Files and directories - cont.

* `DESCRIPTION` provides metadata about your package. We will need to edit this.

--

* `NAMESPACE` declares the functions your package exports for external use and the external functions your package imports from other packages.

--

* The `R/` directory is the “business end” of your package. It will contain .R files with function definitions.

--

* `mypackage.Rproj` is the file that makes this directory an RStudio Project.

---
# Create your first package.

## Build pane appears.

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/createpkg2.png")
```

---
# Create your first package.

## Use version control: Git.

This is optional but strongly recommended.

--

First, make sure Git is configured<sup>1</sup>:

Tools | Shell...

```{r eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.name 'Emma Rand'
git config --global user.email 'emma.rand@york.ac.uk'
git config --global --list
```

.footnote[
[1] [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) is an excellent reference `r Cite(myBib, "Bryan_Happy_Git")`.
]

---
# Create your first package.

## Use version control: Git.

Close your project, reopen it and reload `devtools`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
```

---
# Create your first package.

## Use version control: Git.

Now Git is configured, instruct R to use Git with this Package and project:

```{r eval=FALSE}
use_git()
```

---
# Create your first package.

## Use version control with `use_git()`.

### Commit files.

There are 5 uncommitted files:

Is it OK to commit them?

Choose the option which indicates your agreement.

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/git_agree.png")
```


---
# Create your first package.

## Use version control with `use_git()`.

### Restart R.

A restart of R is required to activate the Git pane. Restart now?

Choose the option which indicates yes. 

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/git_yup.png")
```


---
# Create your first package.

## Use version control with `use_git()`.

### The RStudio Git pane.
.pull-left[
```{r, out.width = "350px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/git_pane.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
If the Git pane does not open, try closing the project and reopening by navigating to it without using the windows shortcuts.

# Create your first package.

## Write your first function.

First, let's create a vector of 100 numbers we can develop our function on.

--

I am going to imagine it is the heights (metres) of 100 trees.

--

```{r}
height <- rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 0.8) %>% 
  round(4)
```

---
# Create your first package.

## Write your first function.

The sums of squares, SS(x), is the sum of the squared deviations from the mean, i.e.,  

$$\sum (x_i- \bar{x})^2$$

--

which is:

```{r}
sum((height - mean(height))^2)
```

---
# Create your first package.

## Write your first function.

We can put that logic into a function:

```{r}
sum_squares <- function(v) {
  sum((v - mean(v))^2)
  }
```

.footnote[
[1] We do not cover writing functions here but you can learn more in the Functions chapter of R for Data Science `r Cite(myBib, "Wickham:2017:RDS:3086927")`
]

---
# Create your first package.

## Write your first function.

and check it works:

```{r}
sum_squares(height)
```


---
# Create your first package.

## Where to put that function: `use_r()`.

We save our function as a `.R` script file in the `R/` directory.

.footnote[
Putting each of the functions in a package in their own `.R` is a good place to start. As your package complexity increases,  you might group related functions.
]
--

But.....

The `use_r()` function makes this a little easier by creating/opening a script below `R/`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
use_r("sum_squares")
```

---
# Create your first package.

## Where to put that function: `use_r()`.

Paste in your function definition.

Do not add any other code. Save the file.

--

Before we continue, delete the function you put in the Global Environment:

```{r}
rm(sum_squares)
```



---
# Create your first package.

## Test drive your function: `load_all()`.

In a normal script, you might use `source("R/sum_squares.R")` but when building packages, we use a `devtools` approach:

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
load_all()
```
```
Loading mypackage
```
.footnote[
[1] The Build pane includes a menu item to run `load_all()` under More.
]
---
# Create your first package.

## Test drive your function: `load_all()`.

`load_all()` will make `sum_squares()` (and any other functions) available for use.


--

Note, you will not see it in your environment! 

---
# Create your first package.

## Test your function after `load_all()`.

`load_all()` simulates the process of building, installing, and attaching the `mypackage` package. 

--

This is more likely to give you an accurate view during package development than testing with functions in the Global Environment.

---
# Create your first package.

## Test your function after `load_all()`.

Now you should be able to use your function just like any other function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sum_squares(rnorm(20))
```
```
[1] 16.1641
```


---
# Create your first package.

## Checking the package with `check()`.

`R CMD check` is the gold standard for checking that an R package is in full working order.

--

It is a programme that is executed in the shell. However, `devtools` has the `check()` function to allow you to run this without leaving your R session.

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
check()
```

---
# Create your first package.

## Checking the package with `check()`.

You will get lots of output. It will end with:

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/check.png")
```

Which tells you that your package is unlicensed and undocumented. We will fix these issues later.

---
# Create your first package.

## Commit your changes with Git.

Go to the Git pane and check the box to "Stage" the changes you want to commit. All of them in this case.

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/git_stage.png")
```

---
# Create your first package.

## Commit your changes with Git.

This will open a "Review Changes" window:

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/git_commit_review.png")
```

This allows you to see what has changed since your last commit. Green means added; pink means deleted.

---
# Create your first package.

## Commit your changes with Git.

You need to add a Commit message. Something like "Added sum_squares function."

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/git_commit_message.png")
```

Now hit Commit!
---
# Create your first package.

## Commit your changes with Git.

A window will appear showing the process occuring.

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/git_commit_window.png")
```

Choose close when it is finished.

---
# Please tell me more about Git!

Oh, okay then `r emo::ji("smiley")`

Before adding a license and documentation to our package we will take a short diversion to cover Git and GitHub.
