# Preliminaries.

## Before we start:

Make sure you have recent versions of:

    .pull-left[
        `devtools`
        `pkgdown`
        `roxygen2`
    ]

.pull-right[
    `testthat`
    `tidyverse`
    `usethis`
]

--

    Load `devtools`

```{r}
library(devtools)
```

    # Preliminaries.

    ## The goal.

    We are going to write a package called `mypackage`<sup>1</sup>. `mypackage` has some simple utilities for a single large sample.

.footnote[
    [1] Or be more creative, silly or serious!
]
--

    It will:
    * calculate the sums of squares
* calculate the standard error
* carry out a one-sample z-test

--

    The package itself is not very useful or wholy original. But what the package does is not the point!
