# Notes on zero to hero course

## Things to improve

- rio unnecessarily confusing as RStudio import returns different code
  - just use readr/readxl/haven directly
- too many ideas at once (R scripts, projects, R markdown)
  - need to get comfortable with one thing before moving on
- notes about good scripts: introduced too early
- break up exercises: all too long and complicated
  - break up and/or provide skeleton code

## Teaching notes

- helps to have R GUI short cut to show standard R GUI first
- in R Demo need to explain *function* and *arguments*, syntax (open/close 
brackets, commas, case-sensitivity)
- make sure people know about vignettes (show during demo or mention at end)
