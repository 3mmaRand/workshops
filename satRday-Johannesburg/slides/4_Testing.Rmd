# Coding is Iterative


We build new functions one bit at a time.

What if a new thing we add changes the existing functionality?

How can we check and be sure all the old functionality still works with New Fancy Feature?

Unit Tests!

# Test Driven Development

---

class: clear

# Set up test infrastructure


```r
usethis::use_testthat()
```
```
✔ Adding 'testthat' to Suggests field
✔ Creating 'tests/testthat/'
✔ Writing 'tests/testthat.R'
✔ Writing 'tests/testthat/test-zooSounds.R'
● Modify 'tests/testthat/test-zooSounds.R'
```

```r
devtools::test()
```
Or Command + Shift + T

class: clear

# So far we've done this:

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../pics/dev_cycle_before_testing.png")
```

class: clear

# Test driven development is a new workflow

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../pics/dev_cycle_with_testing.png")
```

class: clear

# Four expectations cover 90% of cases

```r
expect_equal(object, expected)

expect_error(object, regex)

expect_warning(object, regex)

expect_known_output(code)
```

# Our Example Function

```r
animalSounds <- function(animal, sound){
  assertthat::assert_that(
    assertthat::is.string(animal),
    assertthat::is.string(sound))
  
  paste0("The ", animal, " goes ", sound, "!")
}
```

---

class: clear

# A sample test

In `tests/testthat/test-animalSounds.R`

```
library(testthat)


test_that("animalSounds produces expected strings", {
  giraffe_moo <- animalSounds("giraffe", "moo")
  expect_equal(giraffe_moo, 
               "The giraffe goes moo!")
})
```

---

# Your turn

Write a new unit test for `animalSounds()` using `expect_error()`. 

Run the tests with `Cmd + Shift + T`

---

class: clear

# Tests are organized in three layers

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../pics/test_organization.png")
```

class: clear

# Organizing Tests

Test every individual task the function completes separately.

Check both for successful situations and for expected failure situations

When you stop work, leave a test failing.
