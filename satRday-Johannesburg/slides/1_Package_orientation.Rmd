# Get to know your R installation

---

class: clear font180

Where is R installed on your computer?

```r
R.home()
```

---

class: clear font180

What files are in your R installation?

```r
list.files(R.home())
```

---

class: clear font180

Which version of R are you using?

```r
R.version
```

## Where do R packages come from?

---

class: clear font180

CRAN and GitHub, mostly
.pull-left[
CRAN:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("foo")
```

GitHub:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("jane/foo")
```
]

## Where do R packages live on your computer?

.center[
```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../pics/library.png")
```
]

R packages live in a library.

class: clear font180


## Get to know your R library

The default library:
```r
.Library
```

---

class: clear font180

## Get to know your R library

All the libraries R knows about:
```r
.libPaths()
```


---

class: clear font180


## Get to know your R library

* For many R users `.Library` and `.libPaths()` are the same.  

--

* Other R users maintain, or have access to, multiple libraries.

--

* You may not have write access to the default library.

--

* For example, you can put add-on packages in a user-level library:
`/Users/jenny/resources/R/library`

---

class: clear font180

How many packages do you have installed?

```r
View(installed.packages())
```
How do the packages break down by Priority (and what does that mean, anyway)?

---

class: clear font180

## Startup files

.pull-left[

`.Rprofile`

Code that runs at startup
 - Load workflow packages
 - Set options
 - Use in moderation!
 ]
 
.pull-right[
`.Renviron`

Settings for R
 - Set library paths
 - Set environment variables
]

---

class: clear font180

## Before we start:

Make sure you have recent versions of:

.pull-left[
`devtools`  
`pkgdown`  
`roxygen2`  
]

.pull-right[
`testthat`   
`tidyverse`  
`usethis`  
]

Tip: use `View(old.packages())`

# Packages vs scripts

---

class: clear middle font200

.center[
How is developing a  
**package**
same/different  
from developing a **script**?
]

---

class: clear font180

**How same?**  

Iterate early and often!  

Change it, try it, change it, try it, **ad nauseum**

---

class: clear font180

**How different?**

Write functions not "top-level" code.  

Dependencies are different: no `library()` calls

Install & restart (or simulate that): don't `source()`

---

# Your turn

Look at 
1. Where’s the R code? What is it mostly comprised of?
2. What do you think is in the DESCRIPTION file? How
about the NAMESPACE file?
3. MAN-what?

---

.center[
Use `devtools::load_all( )` a lot!  

(And “Install and Restart” sparingly)
]
