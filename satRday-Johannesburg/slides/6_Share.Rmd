```
Depends: 
  R (>= 3.0.2) # optional version spec
Imports:
  stringr (>= 1.0.0),
  lubridate
Suggests:
```

**Depends**: I need you!
**Suggests**: I like having you around!

---

class: clear

There are three types of dependency

**Imports**: required, installed automatically.
**Suggests**: optional, e.g. only needed for development; only used in
vignette or example. *Not* installed automatically.
**Depends**: basically deprecated for packages.
(Correct uses exist, but beyond the scope of this class)

---

class: clear

Use `::` to access functions in imported packages

In DESCRIPTION
```
Imports: pkgname
```

In `new_function.R`
```r
new_function <- function(x, y, z) {
  pkgname::imported_function(x, y) + z
}
```

---

class: clear

Should check if suggested package available

In DESCRIPTION
```
Suggests: pkgname
```

In `new_function.R`
```r
new_function <- function(x, y, z) {
  if (!requireNamespace("pkgname", quietly = TRUE)){
    warning("pkgname must be installed to perform this function", 
            "returning NULL")
    return(NULL)
  } else {
    pkgname::imported_function(x, y) + z
  }
}
```

Exit gracefully (without an error) if possible. The main functionality of 
your package should not require suggested packages.

# Reasons to use depends instead of imports

class: clear

# `use_package()`

`use_package()` will modify the DESCRIPTION and remind you how to use the
function.

usethis::use_package("glue", "suggests")
```

# Namespace: imports

# You might get tired of using :: all the time

Or you might want to use an infix function
```r
`%>%` <- magittr::`%>%`

col_summary <- function(df, fun) {
  stopifnot(is.data.frame(df))
  
  df %>% 
    purrr::keep(is.numeric) %>% 
    purrr::modify(fun)
}

```

---

class: clear

# You can **import** functions into the package

```r
#' @importFrom purrr keep modify
#' @importFrom magrittr %>%
col_summary <- function(df, fun) {
  stopifnot(is.data.frame(df))
  
  df %>% 
    keep(is.numeric) %>% 
    modify(fun)
}
```

---

class: clear

# Alternatively, create R/imports.R

Imports belong to the package, not to individual functions, so you might want 
to recognise this by storing in a central location

```r
#' @importFrom purrr keep map
#' @importFrom magrittr %>%
NULL
```

---

class: clear

# Importing everything from a package seems easy

```r
#' @import purrr
col_summary <- function(df, fun) {
  stopifnot(is.data.frame(df))
  
  df %>% 
    keep(is.numeric) %>% 
    map_dfc(fun)
}

```

class: clear

# But is dangerous...

```r
#' @import pkg1
#' @import pkg2
fun <- function(x) {
  fun1(x) + fun2(x)
}

```

Works today...

... But next year, **pkg2** adds a `fun1` function

Documentation optional      | Must be documented
Easily changed              | Changing will break other people’s code

class: clear

# Better to export functions explicitly

```r
#' @export
fun1 <- function(...) {}

#' @export
fun2 <- function(...) {}
```

Most important if you’re planning on sharing with others

---

class: clear

# Export functions that people should use

Don't export internal helpers

```r
# Defaults for NULL values

# Remove NULLs from a list
compact <- function(x) {
  x[!vapply(x, is.null, logical(1))]
}

# R CMD check

---

class: clear

# Automated checking


Runs automated checks for common problems in R packages.

Useful for local packages, even with some false positives.

If you want to submit to CRAN, you must pass R CMD check cleanly.

# Types of problem

**ERROR** Must fix!

**WARNING** Fix if submitting to CRAN

**NOTE** Fix if submitting to CRAN

It is possible to submit with a NOTE, but it’s best avoided

# Run the checks

```
# Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + E

If you don't understand an error, google it!

# CRAN

---

class: clear

# First submission to CRAN

First check locally
```r
devtools::check()
```

Then on R-hub
```r
devtools::check_rhub()
```

Then with CRAN's win-builder
```r
devtools::check_win()
```

Write submission notes
```r
usethis::use_cran_comments()
```

Then submit to CRAN
```r
devtools::release()
```

This asks you questions which you should carefully read and answer

---

class: clear

# cran-comments.md

```
## Test environments
* local OS X install (R-release)
* win-builder (R-release, R-devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
```

There’s always one note for a new submission

---

class: clear

# If your submission fails

Do not despair! It happens to everyone, even R-core members.

If it’s from the CRAN robot, just fix the problem & resubmit.

If it’s from a human, do not respond to the email and do not
argue. Instead update cran-comments.md & resubmit.

---

class: clear

# For resubmission

```
This is a resubmission. Compared to the last submission, I
have:

* First change.
* Second change.
* Third change.

---
## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
...
```

---

class: clear
 
# Subsequent submissions to CRAN

Proceed as before. If you have reverse dependencies you need to also run 
R CMD check on them, and  notify CRAN if you have deliberately broken them.

Fortunately the revdepcheck package makes this fairly easy

```
install_github("r-lib/revdepcheck")
use_revdep_check()
library(revdepcheck)
revdep_check()
revdep_report_cran()
```
