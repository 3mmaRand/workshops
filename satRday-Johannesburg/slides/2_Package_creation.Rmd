Workflow: you should have one

A package is a set of  
conventions that  
*(with the right tools)*  
makes your life easier

Seriously, it doesn’t have to be  
about sharing your code  
(although that is an added  
benefit!). It is about saving  
yourself time.

# Why use RStudio projects?

**3** reasons

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}

Work on multiple projects  
simultaneously and independently

# My first package

---

# Your turn

Verify that you can create a package with:
```r
usethis::create_package("~/Desktop/mypackage")
```

What other files and directories are created?

You can also create new project using RStudio  
but it has some slight differences that will  
cause hassles today (but not in general)

---

# What happens when we run `create_package()`?


```r
create_package("mypackage")
```

---

* `mypackage.Rproj` is the file that makes this directory an RStudio Project.

--

* The `R/` directory contains `.R` files with function definitions.

--

* `DESCRIPTION` provides metadata about your package. We will need to edit this.

--

* `NAMESPACE` declares the functions your package exports for external use and the external functions your package imports from other packages.

---

class: clear

# Why bother?

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../pics/dev_cycle_before_testing.png")
```

--

You don't even need to save your code!

---

class: clear

# Now that you have your package, what do you put in it?

There's a usethis helper for adding `.R` files!

```r
usethis::use_r("file-name")
```

Organize files so that related code
lives together. If you can give a file
a concise and informative name, it's
probably about right

---

# Your turn

- Create a new R file in your package called `animalSounds.R`

- Paste the following code into your script:

```{r}
animalSounds <- function(animal, sound){
  assertthat::assert_that(
    assertthat::is.string(animal),
    assertthat::is.string(sound))
  
  paste0("The ", animal, " goes ", sound, "!")
}
```

*Hint:* a completed version is on GitHub 

---

# Your turn

- Change some tiny thing about your function - maybe the animal “says” instead 
of “goes”?

- Load all with devtools::load_all() and test the function

- Try adding yourself as an author to the package in DESCRIPTION, add a fun 
title and description

Woohoo, you did it!
